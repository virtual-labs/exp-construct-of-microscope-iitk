1.	Place the microscope on a flat surface.<br>
2.	Plug in the power cord and turn on the light from the illuminator.<br>
3.	Place the specimen onto the stage of the microscope.  If the specimen is a glass slide, then fasten it with the stage clips. <br>
4.	Move the revolving nosepiece or turret to position an objective lens with the lowest magnifying power (usually 4x or 10x) over the specimen.<br>
5.	Look through the eyepiece and position the objective lens using the coarse and fine adjustment knobs to bring the specimen into focus.  Do not let the objective lens touch the specimen/glass slide at any time.<br>
6.	Adjust the condenser lens and diaphragm to control the light entering the microscope.<br>
7.	Using the diopter adjustment ring, try to focus the specimen using each eyepiece lens.<br>
8.	Move the slide/sample around to examine the place of interest using the mechanical knobs.<br>
9.	Using the fine focus adjustment knob, position the objective lens to focus the specimen.<br>
10.	Readjust the condenser and diaphragm for a clear image.<br>
11.	Record the image through a camera.<br>
12.	Once the specimen has been examined at the lowest magnification, enhance the magnification by revolving the nosepiece and selecting a high-magnifying power objective lens<br>
13.	Readjust the position of the objective lens into focus and readjust the condenser lens and diaphragm.<br>
14.	After imaging, lower the stage, put the objective lens of the lowest magnifying power into position, remove the specimen and turn off the illuminator
